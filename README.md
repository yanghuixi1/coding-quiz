# Coding-Quiz

This is a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. Time will be subtracted from the clock if a question is answered incorrectly. When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over. When the game is over, players can save their score with their initials, and then view the ranked high scores of others as well.
